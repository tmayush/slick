            <strong>Personal information we collect</strong> <br />
            When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain
            information about your device, including information about your web
            browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are

            collect information about the individual web pages or products that
            you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site,
            and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to
            this automatically-collected information as “Device Information”.
            <br />
            <br />
            We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
            <br />
            - “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or
            computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more
            information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
            http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
            <br />
            - “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data
            including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider,
            referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps. <br />
            - “Web beacons”, “tags”, and “pixels” are electronic files used to
            record information about how you browse the Site. <br />

            Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase
            through the Site, we collect certain information from you, including
            your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information
            (including credit card numbers [[INSERT ANY OTHER PAYMENT TYPES

            MARKETING DATA/LISTS]] <br />
            <br />

            are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.
            <br />

            invoices and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this
            Order Information to: <br />
            - Communicate with you; <br />
